**Agentic AI** Instructed by AI pioneer Andrew Ng, Generative AI for Everyone offers his unique perspective on empowering you and your work with generative AI. Andrew will 
guide you through how generative AI works and what it can (and can’t) do. It includes hands-on exercises where you’ll learn to use generative AI to help in day-to-day work and 
receive tips on effective prompt engineering, as well as learning how to go beyond prompting for more advanced uses of AI.
You’ll delve into real-world applications and learn common use cases, and get hands-on time with generative AI tools to put your knowledge into action, and gain insight into AI’s 
impact on both business and society.
This course was created to ensure everyone can be a participant in our AI-powered future.
