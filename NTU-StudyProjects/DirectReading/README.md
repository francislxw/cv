#### Abstract

*Three-dimensional geometric models are the base data for applications in computer graphics, computer aided design, visualization, multimedia, and other related fields. This report surveys state-of-the-art interactive shape editing techniques. It covers free-form deformation, mean value coordinates discrete Laplace, Poisson-based gradient algorithm and differential coordinates techniques for creating, manipulating, editing and analyzing digital geometry models, mainly on computerized modeling of discrete (digital) geometry, in particular polygonal meshes.*
