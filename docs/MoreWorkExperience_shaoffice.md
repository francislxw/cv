## V. Form DevOps team and Set up Automation building process for Inventor, Vault, ETO

•	Role: Leader (5 Persons) 

•	Time: Feb 2008-Nov 2011

•	Description

Start to form DevOps team with five persons, focus on maintaining all steps of Inventor, Vault, ETO product’s build process, involves syncing source code, compiling, master (digital sign, obfuscator) and posting. Refine the building process and make it highly automated.

•	Achievement

1. Make Official build come out on time every Monday ACRD/ASRD time.

2. Make four Continuous builds come out every workday.

3. Tackle issues/requirements from ACRD/ASRD developers at once in our time zone. 

4. Refine current building process, make it highly automated.

5. Create hotfixes, especially for Damascus & Omaha releases.

6. Create Backpatch builds, especially for Hopper, SikorSky (Inventor) and Damascus & Omaha (Vault), integrate the building process to the Build Forge tool.

## VI. Develop two tools iTuneUp and MSDPSCollector

-iTuneUp Tool: Inventor Performance Analysis on PCs

- MSDPSCollector Tool: Collect Customers’ PC information when Inventor crashes

•	Role: Leader (3 Persons) 

•	Time: Feb 2008-Feb 2009

•	Description

Inventor related project/Tools to improve Inventor building/working process.

•	Technology

VC++, STL, C#, Win32 API, Inventor API, Incredibuild, Perforce, WMIC

•	Achievement

1. Research the project’s probability and how it will affect current Inventor.

2. Schedule how much resource this project needs.

3. Plan the milestone of the project

4. Design check points of every milestone, control product’s quality.

5. Solve problems met in the projects.

6. Write Add-In by C# to analyze this project.

7. Communicate with US Leader to exchange working states & report problems.

## VII. Reduce Inventor Build Cost

•	Role: Leader (3 Persons)

•	Time: Feb 2007-Feb 2008

•	Description

Write two Tools to analyse Head Files, DLL files relationships, remove redundant #inclusion in the head files, and don’t export functions in DLL those aren’t used, write three Addins to analyze MACROS usage in the Inventor source code, disconnect or remove the unnecessary relationship between MACROs.

•	Technology
VC++, XML, Incredibuild, Perforce

•	Achievement

1. Research how Assembly, Part of Inventor works.

2. Develop two tools: HFTool & DLLTool 

3. Research relationships between functions need to reduce with above two Tools.

4. Design safe key method to remove head files /functions in DLL don’t need anymore.

5. Test above removes manipulation, communicate with QAs to fix defects.

6. At last reduced Inventor Build cost about: 13%.

## VIII. C4a, AEC Block Management
•	Role: Developer                          
•	Time: May 2005-Feb 2007
•	Description
C4a can be looked as an Equivalent Version of Inventor but written by C#.
•	Technology: C#, XML, Design Patterns, VC++, ARX, DBX, OMF, XML, DWG
•	Achievement
1. In C4a, design structure of ‘material library’ and Implement function of managing ‘material library’.
2. In ‘AEC Block Management’ project, design Controls of a block on a UI, implement functions to manage Line type, Layers, Colors, etc. properties of a block, implementing preview of the block on UI.
3. Communicate with QAs to fix defects.
