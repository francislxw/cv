## I.Advice for Applying Machine Learning
Applying machine learning in practice is not always straightforward. In this module, we share best practices for applying machine learning in practice, and discuss the best ways to evaluate performance of the learned models.
## Contents 
* Deciding What to Try Next
* Evaluating a Hypothesis
* Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets
* Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance
* Regularization and Bias/Variance
* Learning Curves
* Deciding What to Do Next Revisited

## II.Machine Learning System Design
To optimize a machine learning algorithm, youâ€™ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In this module, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.
